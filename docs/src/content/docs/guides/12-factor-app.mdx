The Twelve-Factor App is a set of best practices for building modern, scalable, and maintainable software-as-a-service applications. It provides a battle-tested guide for creating robust applications that are easy to deploy and manage.

This document focuses on the third and one of the most critical factors: **Configuration**.

## Factor III: Config

> An app’s config is everything that is likely to vary between deploys (development, staging, production). This includes database credentials, API keys for external services, or environment-specific feature flags. — [https://12factor.net/config](https://12factor.net/config)

A core rule of the 12-Factor methodology is the **strict separation of code and config**. Your codebase should remain the same across all deployment environments, while the configuration changes.

A simple test for this is to ask: "Could you make your codebase open-source at any moment without compromising any credentials?" If the answer is no, you have configuration mixed in with your code.

### A Practical, Modern Approach

While the 12-Factor methodology advocates for storing all configuration in environment variables, a common and powerful pattern is to use a hybrid approach. This combines the clarity of configuration files with the flexibility of environment variables.

#### 1. Configuration Files for Defaults and Structure

Start with base configuration files that are isolated from your application code. These files are excellent for:

-   Defining default values for your application.
-   Establishing the schema or "shape" of your configuration based on the target environment.
-   Storing non-sensitive, environment-agnostic settings.

These files can be checked into version control, but they **must not contain any secrets** like passwords or API keys. They serve as the foundational, default layer of your configuration.

#### 2. Environment Variable Overrides for Flexibility and Security

For any setting that changes between environments or is sensitive, you should use **environment variables** to override the values defined in your configuration files.

This approach is superior to hardcoding conditional logic (e.g., `if environment is 'production' then use this value`) directly in your application. By using overrides, your code remains clean and unaware of the specific environment it's running in.

Environment variables are the ideal way to inject deployment-specific settings because they are:

-   **Secure:** Secrets are never stored in your codebase. They are supplied by the deployment environment (e.g., a Docker container, a CI/CD pipeline, or a PaaS).
-   **Flexible:** You can easily change a database URL or an API key for a production deployment without touching a single line of code or a config file.
-   **Standardized:** They are a language- and OS-agnostic standard, making your application highly portable.

### Key Takeaways

-   **Separate Code and Config:** Never hardcode configuration values like credentials or hostnames in your code.
-   **Use Files for a Base:** Use configuration files to define the shape and default values of your application's settings.
-   **Use Environment Variables to Override:** For secrets and environment-specific values, use environment variables as the ultimate source of truth. This is cleaner and more robust than conditional logic in your code.
-   **Never Commit Secrets:** Your application's repository should always be safe to make public.
