You may need to define your configuration in a file while also sourcing values from environment variables.

Consider the following configuration file:

```json
// config/base.json
{
  "appURL": "http://localhost:3000",
  "port": 3000
}
```

Notice that the port number is used in two places. Instead of hardcoding this value, you can use a `PORT` variable defined in your environment, such as in a `.env` file:

```env
PORT=3000
```

To reference this environment variable, you can use a "slot":

```json
// config/base.json
{
  "appURL": "http://localhost:$PORT",
  "port": "$PORT"
}
```

When Layerfig processes your configuration, it searches for slots and replaces them with the corresponding environment variable's value:

```
$PORT => PORT => 3000
```

## Caveats

If an environment variable for a slot is not defined, Layerfig will not perform a replacement. The configuration value will retain the original slot string:

```ts
config.appURL; // "http://localhost:$PORT"
```

Additionally, all environment variables are treated as strings. If a slot is used for a value that should be a number, like `port`, the resulting configuration will have a string value:

```js
const finalConfig = {
  appURL: "http://localhost:3000",
  port: "3000"
}
```

To handle this, you can use a validation schema to coerce the string value into a number. For example, with Zod:

```ts {5}
import { z } from 'zod/v4'

const schema = z.object({
	appURL: z.string(),
	port: z.coerce.number().positive().int(),
});
```

The `z.coerce.number()` function will parse the string `"3000"` and transform it into the number `3000`.
