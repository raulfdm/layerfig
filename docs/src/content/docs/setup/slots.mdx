You may need to define your configuration in a file while also sourcing values from environment variables.

Consider the following configuration file:

```json
// config/base.json
{
  "appURL": "http://localhost:3000",
  "port": 3000
}
```

Notice that the port number is used in two places. Instead of hardcoding this value, you can use a `PORT` variable defined in your environment, for example, in a `.env` file:

```env
PORT=3000
```

To reference this environment variable, you can use a "slot":

```json
// config/base.json
{
  "appURL": "http://localhost:$PORT",
  "port": "$PORT"
}
```

When Layerfig processes your configuration, it searches for slots and replaces them with the corresponding environment variable's value:

```
$PORT => PORT => 3000
```

## Caveats

If an environment variable for a slot is not defined, Layerfig will not perform a replacement. The configuration value will retain the original slot string:

```ts
config.appURL; // "http://localhost:$PORT"
```

Additionally, all environment variables are treated as strings. If a slot is used for a value that should be a number, like `port`, the resulting configuration will have a string value:

```js
const finalConfig = {
  appURL: "http://localhost:3000",
  port: "3000",
};
```

To handle this, you can use a validation schema to coerce the string value into a number. For example, with Zod:

```ts {5}
import { z } from "@layerfig/config/zod";

const schema = z.object({
  appURL: z.string(),
  port: z.coerce.number().positive().int(),
});
```

The `z.coerce.number()` function will parse the string `"3000"` and transform it into the number `3000`.

## Different Prefix

By default, Layerfig uses `$` as the slot prefix, but you can change it by passing the [`slotPrefix`](/setup/configuration/#optionsslotprefix) option.

## Chaining Environment Variables

There are cases where you might want to try multiple environment variables for a single value, providing a chain of options in a specific order of priority.

For example, imagine you want to determine the current Git branch. This value could be sourced from several environment variables:

1.  `process.env.GIT_REF`
2.  `process.env.REF`
3.  `process.env.MAIN_REF`

To achieve this, you can use the extended slot syntax, separating each variable name with a colon:

```json
{
  "branch": "${GIT_REF:REF:MAIN_REF}"
}
```

Layerfig processes this from left to right. It checks for `GIT_REF`, then `REF`, and so on, using the first defined environment variable it finds. If no environment variables in the chain are found, Layerfig will preserve the original slot string.

## Literal Fallbacks

In addition to chaining variables, you can also provide a literal fallback value to be used if none of the environment variables are set.

This is achieved by adding the `:-` operator to the extended slot syntax. This works even with a single variable:

```json
{
  "port": "${PORT:-3000}"
}
```

If the `PORT` environment variable is not defined, Layerfig will use `3000` as the value.

Of course, this operator can be combined with variable chaining for more complex cases:

```json
{
  "branch": "${GIT_REF:REF:MAIN_REF:-main}"
}
```

If none of the `GIT_REF`, `REF`, or `MAIN_REF` environment variables are found, the value will fall back to the literal string `main`.
